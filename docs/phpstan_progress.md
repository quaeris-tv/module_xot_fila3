### Modules In Progress

#### Setting Module
- Issues fixed:
  - Added null checks in `CreateDatabaseConnection.php` for accessing properties of database connections
  - Added null checks in `EditDatabaseConnection.php` for accessing the record property
  - Updated `ListDatabaseConnections.php` to include proper type annotations

- Current issues still to fix:
  - Method return type issues in `CreateDatabaseConnection::getRedirectUrl()`
  - Undefined property access in various files
  - Undefined method calls
  - Type issues with table filters in `ListDatabaseConnections.php`

#### Xot Module
- Issues fixed:
  - Fixed template types in `ExportXlsStreamByLazyCollection.php`
  - Added proper type casting in `XlsByModelClassAction.php`
  - Fixed string casting and removed redundant is_string checks in `AutoLabelAction.php`
  - Fixed casting issues in `ResourceFormSchemaGenerator.php`
  - Added proper null handling and numeric type conversion in `InformationSchemaTable.php`

- Issues still to fix:
  - Multiple PHPStan errors remaining that need to be addressed systematically

## Next Steps

1. Complete fixes in the Setting module:
   - Fix the return type of `getRedirectUrl()` methods
   - Fix undefined property/method issues by properly typing models

2. Continue working on the Xot module:
   - Test the fixes we've implemented so far
   - Address remaining errors systematically

3. Run PHPStan on the entire codebase at level 10 to identify any additional issues

## Notes for Next Session

- Focus on completing the Setting module first to ensure it's error-free
- Then continue with the Xot module which has more complex issues
- Consider grouping fixes by error type (type annotations, null checks, method access) for efficiency
